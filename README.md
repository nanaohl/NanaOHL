Hello, I’m Nana Hughes-Lartey—a Designer & Developer based in Glasgow. I co-founded **Uncover Commerce**, where I spend my time building web and mobile experiences . Over the years, I’ve also had a hand in running **Nextfootball.com, Illicit Magazine, Founders Podcast, and Made By Logic**, which means I’ve juggled everything from code to company strategy (sometimes both at once). I love bringing ideas to life, solving tricky problems, and figuring out what’s next in tech and business.
