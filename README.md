### Hey, I'm Nana

Designer, developer, and serial starter of things — based in Glasgow.

I co-founded **Uncover Commerce**, where I build web and mobile experiences that people actually want to use. Before that (and alongside it), I've built and run **Nextfootball.com**, **Illicit Magazine**, **Founders Podcast**, and **Made By Logic** — so yeah, I've worn every hat from writing code to writing strategy decks, sometimes in the same afternoon.

At my core, I'm a programmer. I like taking a vague idea, breaking it down, and turning it into something real. The messier the problem, the better.

```
currently: shipping things at Uncover Commerce
previously: too many side projects to list
always: curious about what's next
```

If AI takes over, it's been a fun ride.
